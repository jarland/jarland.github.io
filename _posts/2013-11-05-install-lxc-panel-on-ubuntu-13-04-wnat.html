<p>Sometimes OpenVZ is more than I want on a dedicated server. Sometimes I want a new kernel. LXC is container based "virtualization" that provides a native performance alongside the host operating system, much like OpenVZ does. Additionally, sometimes I want to separate the environment which houses my individual services but I don't necessarily need a bunch of IPs. I might have ZNC in one, a web server in another, nothing that particularly conflicts, I just prefer the service isolation. This is how I achieve the result that I desire.</p>

<p>Here is a look at the web based administration panel that you will be working with.</p>
<p><a href="http://jarland.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/screenshot01s.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23" alt="screenshot01s" src="assets/screenshot01s.png" width="700" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>On a fresh installation of Ubuntu 13.04, run the following command:</p>
<blockquote><p>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -y upgrade &amp;&amp; apt-get -y install lxc</p></blockquote>
<p>After this finishes, it's time to install LXC Web Panel.</p>
<blockquote><p>wget http://lxc-webpanel.github.io/tools/install.sh -O - | bash</p></blockquote>
<p>Once this installs, visit http://[your IP or hostname]:5000 and login with the credentials below.</p>
<blockquote><p>Username: admin<br />
Password: admin</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously you are going to want to change that inside the panel. While I enjoy writing, I am going to intentionally leave out how to create a new LXC container inside this web interface. I'll give you a hint, it involves "Create CT."</p>
<p>LXC Web Panel is going to create a new container for you with an internal IP address. Use the following guide:</p>
<blockquote><p>[one] - Port to forward to the container.<br />
[two] - Your primary network interface. Usually eth0 or eth1.<br />
[three] - The IP of the container.<br />
[four] - The port you want to send the traffic to on the container.</p></blockquote>
<p>To replace the correct parts of the following iptables command:</p>
<blockquote><p>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -m tcp -p tcp --dport [one] -j DNAT -i [two] --to-destination [three]:[four]</p></blockquote>
<p>For example, if my LXC container is 10.0.1.3 and I want to forward web requests, on port 80, to the container, I would use the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT -i eth0 --to-destination 10.0.1.3:80</p></blockquote>
<p>Now here's the fun part. How do we control the container via command line? Here's the most useful ones for basic functionality.</p>
<blockquote><p>List containers:<br />
lxc-list</p>
<p>Enter container:<br />
lxc-attach —-name [container name]</p>
<p>Start container:<br />
lxc-start —-name [container name]</p>
<p>Stop container:<br />
lxc-stop —-name [container name]</p></blockquote>
