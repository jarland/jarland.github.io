<p>Throughout the years I have worked with Wordpress installations whether it be for friends, family, colleagues, or for a company. Wordpress is an excellent platform, and one that many of us like to refer people to that may not have a background in web development, but wants to design and publish their own website. It is that line between easy to use and capable of endless extension. However, what ends up happening is that we send all of these new Wordpress users out into the world with no understanding of the consequences of not maintaining or optimizing their website.</p>
