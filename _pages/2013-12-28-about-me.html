My name is Jarland Donnell and I am a self proclaimed Linux System Administrator. I started this blog to document the things that I learn along the way, as well as share what I learn with others who are interested in the same field as myself.</p>
<p>In 2011, together with my friend Ryan Arp, we started a company named Catalyst Host. I have since left Catalyst Host but I still work in the hosting industry. That's all there is to say about me. Keep it simple!</p>
